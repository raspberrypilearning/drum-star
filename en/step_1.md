## Introduction

In this project, you are going to make a clicker game where you earn beats to play new drums and bigger venues.

You will:
+ Use `variables`{:class="block3variables"} to store and change numbers and change text (words),
+ `ask`{:class="block3sensing"} a question and use the `answer`{:class="block3sensing"} to customise the game,
+ Use `if...else`{:class="block3control"} to control what happens next.

There are lots of <span style="color: #0faeb0">**clicker games**</span> where you have to click to make progress and buy upgrades that help you go faster. Have you ever played a clicker game? There are also idle games that keep going even when you're not playing them. These games are fun as long as you don't spend too much time playing them!</p>

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click the drum and watch the number of `beats` go up. Get a new drum when you have enough beats. 

How many `beats` do you earn when clicking the new drum?
