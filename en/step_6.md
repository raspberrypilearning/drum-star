Play your game and earn beats. 

Watch the `beats`{:class="block3variables"} variable change and make sure you understand how beats increase when you click the drums and decrease when you get a new drum.

Are you happy with how many beats you earn for each drum? You can change this if you like.

Are you happy with how many beats it costs to get a new drum?

**Tip:** Test your project regularly so you can find and fix any bugs.
