Ти маєш заробляти 2 удари щоразу, як натискаєш на малий барабан.

--- /task ---

Наступний барабан не буде доступним на початку проєкту. Його треба заробити за допомогою ударів.

--- task ---

Add a script to the **Drum-snare** sprite to hide it at the start of the project:

```blocks3

Add a button to show which drum is the next and how many beats it will cost.

--- task ---

**Duplicate** the **Get** sprite:

Click on the **Code** tab and add a script to show the **Get snare** sprite at the start of the project:

![](images/get-snare-icon.png)

The next drum can only be unlocked if the user has `10` or more beats.

--- task ---

Add this code to unlock the next drum `if`{:class="block3control"} the player has enough beats, or `say`{:class="block3looks"} `More beats needed!` if they do not have enough:

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
if <(beats)>  [9]> then //if 10 or more beats
hide
change [beats v] by [-10] //take away the cost of upgrade
else
say [More beats needed!] for [2] seconds 
end
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add a `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} block to send a new `snare` message:

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
if <(beats)>  [9]> then // if 10 or more beats
hide
change [beats v] by [-10] // take away the cost of upgrade
+ broadcast (snare v) // your drum name
else
say [More beats needed!] for [2] seconds
end
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click on the **Drum-snare** sprite.

![](images/snare-icon.png)

Add this script:

```blocks3
when I receive [snare v]
show
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your project.

You should not be able to unlock the next drum before you have enough beats.

--- /task ---

When you unlock new drums, you can play at bigger venues!

--- task ---

Add another backdrop. We chose **Chalkboard** to play our second gig at school.

**Tip:** Choose a venue that's a small step up from a bedroom. You want to save bigger venues for later!

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click on the Stage.

![](images/stage-icon.png)

Add code to the Stage to `switch backdrop`{:class="block3looks"} when the upgrade message is received:

```blocks3
when I receive [snare v]
switch backdrop to [Chalkboard v]
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your project.

When you unlock the next drum: the snare should appear, the button disappears, the venue changes and the `beats`{:class="block3variables"} go down by `10`.

--- /task ---
